It can be easy to solve these problems if there are small inputs but the time it takes can increase exponentially meaning it can take years to solve such problems. So to solve these problems, computer scientists donâ€™t find the perfect solution but rather the approximate solution. This can be done using a heuristic which is a method that allows an algorithm to find good choices in solutions instead of looking at every possible solution which means that it gives up some accuracy to actually solve the problem. So let's take a look at an example of heuristics.</div>\n                                    <div class='tab_header'>Heuristics</div>\n                                    <div class='paragraph'>The problem is known as the traveling salesperson problem where you're supposed to figure out the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the original city given a list of cities and their distances between each pair of cities. </div>\n                                    <div class='paragraph'>The main reason this problem is difficult to solve with many inputs is that it's a combination based problem where the computer would have to try every single combination of each path between cities to find the shortest distance which is known as the brute force approach. This wonâ€™t take very long for a computer to solve if the inputs are small but increasing the inputs will cause the processing time to increase exponentially which can be problematic.</div>\n                                    <div class='paragraph'>So let's see how we can solve this problem with heuristics. When you want to create a heuristic, you simply need to consider how you would solve the problem. We are better at finding shortcuts that are a good enough solution to a problem. This doesnâ€™t waste time, but not all heuristics are equal as some can provide more accurate solutions and take less time.</div>\n                                    <div class='paragraph'>A good heuristic for the problem above is known as the nearest neighbor heuristic in which the computer picks the nearest unvisited city as the next city path. Simply by doing this, we can figure out which route between cities is the fastest. Remember that this solution is an approximate and not the 100% correct solution. So many heuristics are developed to see what will get the closest to figuring out the perfect solution while also considering the time it will take to solve the problem.</div>\n                                    <div class='tab_header'>Undecidable problems</div>\n                                    <div class='paragraph'>There can be some problems that computers canâ€™t solve as they would take all the time in the world to find the solution and they wouldnâ€™t decide on it. So this leads us to an undecidable problem which is a problem that should give a yes or no output but no algorithm can do this correctly accounting for all inputs. Other undecidable problems are based on determining various attributes of input and output of programs. So the program canâ€™t give a yes or no for all of the inputs. An example of this is an infinite loop. Programs can't determine if it's an infinite loop because it's undecidable. So the way to solve this is to create an approximate solution by timing to see how long the loop takes and if it takes longer than needed the code can stop.</div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"tab_label\" label=\"Quiz\">\n                                <Fragment>\n                                    <Quiz \n                                        quizdata={\n                                            {\n                                              question: \"What do computer scientists do if a problem would take a computer years to find the solution?\",\n                                              FindAnswer:[\"Computer scientists donâ€™t find the perfect solution but rather the approximate solution\", \"Computer scientists move on and try to solve a similar problem\", \"Computer scientists improve the computerâ€™s hardware so that the computer can solve problems faster\", \"Computer scientists try remaking the algorithm to solve the problem in a different method\"], \n                                              rightAnswer:\"Computer scientists donâ€™t find the perfect solution but rather the approximate solution\"\n                                            }\n                                        }\n                                    />\n                                    <Quiz \n                                        quizdata={\n                                            {\n                                                question: \"What is a heuristic?\",\n                                                FindAnswer:[ \"A method that speeds up the computer to allow for the computer to be able to solve problems faster\", \"A method that allows an algorithm to find good choices in solutions instead of looking at every possible solution\", \"A method that allows an algorithm to only use a few inputs to get a solution at a faster speed\", \"None of the above\"], \n                                                rightAnswer:\"A method that allows an algorithm to find good choices in solutions instead of looking at every possible solution\"\n                                            }\n                                        }\n                                    />\n                                    <Quiz \n                                        quizdata={\n                                            {\n                                                question: \"What makes a problem an unsolvable problem for a computer?\",\n                                                FindAnswer:[ \"When a problem that should give a yes or no output but no algorithm can do this correctly while still using all inputs\", \"If it takes more than a year for the computer to solve the problem\", \"All of the above\", \"None of the above\"], \n                                                rightAnswer:\"When a problem that should give a yes or no output but no algorithm can do this correctly while still using all inputs\"\n                                            }\n                                        }\n                                    />\n                                    <Quiz \n                                        quizdata={\n                                            {\n                                                question: \"What's an example of an unsolvable problem for a computer?\",\n                                                FindAnswer:[ \"Sorting and searching databases with algorithms\", \"Extremely advanced mathematics\", \"Graph algorithms\", \"An infinite loop\"], \n                                                rightAnswer:\"An infinite loop\"\n                                            }\n                                        }\n                                    />\n                                </Fragment> \n                                </div>\n                     \n                            </Tabs>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class = \"bottom_section\">\n                    <Fade bottom><div><div class =\"lesson_backbutton\"><Link to='/CSP'><button class=\"grow\">View Other Lessons</button></Link></div></div></Fade>\n                </div> \n\n            </div>\n        )\n      }\n}\n\nexport default Unit4Lesson2;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
