When you want to send a letter or package to someone, you have to mention what specific address you want to send the package to. In a similar sense, your computer has a unique address that allows you to receive specific data from someone else. When you want to send data to another person, you have to specify the IP address of the person your sending the data to.</div>\n                                    \n                                    <div class=\"paragraph\">There are 2 different internet protocols, IPv4 and IPv6.</div>\n                                    <div class=\"paragraph\">IPv4 is the first version of the internet protocol that has 4 billion possible IP address combinations. The IP address is split into 4 parts separated by periods and each value is a number between 0 and 255. This is so that the computer can store the data in binary with 8 bits of data for each segment.</div>\n                                    <div class=\"paragraph\">But because there are now more than 4 billion people using the internet, we need IPv6. With IPv6, there are 8 different segments of numbers but this time the numbers are based on hexadecimal values meaning there are 16 different numbers you can put into one slot and one slot has 4 spaces. Some values in hexadecimal are represented with letters.</div>\n                                    <div class=\"paragraph\">There are now much more possible IP addresses with IPv6. Each 4-digit hexadecimal number can range between 0 and 65,535. Now multiply this by 8 so there are roughly 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 different combinations</div>\n                                    <div class=\"paragraph\">You can simply check your IP address by googling it because your computer sends information to google and therefore it will know your IP address. Your IP address can change which is called a dynamic IP address. Different wifi networks provide different IPs. </div>\n                                    <div class=\"paragraph\">But with static server-based computers, will tend to have a static IP because it will make it easier for people to connect to the website</div>\n                                    <div class=\"paragraph\">IP addresses are also hierarchical allowing data to be transferred quicker. IP addresses are broken up into parts where certain portions of the address indicate certain things. For example, the first 2 segments of numbers in an IP address can represent the network provider and the other 2 segments of numbers are unique.
